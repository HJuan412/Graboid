    "# K-NN\n",
    "The K-NN algorithm places training and query instances in an $N$-dimensional sample space determined by the set of $N$ selected attributes in the dataset. Each instance's position in the sample space is determined by its values at the selected attributes. The core assumption of the algorithm is:\n",
    "> Instances belonging to a given class $C$ will exibit simmilar values at the selected attributes and therefore will cluster together in the sample space\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a query instance $Q$ beloning to an undetermined class $C_q$, the value of $C_q$ can be inferred by placing $Q$ in the sample space and determining the most frecuent class value among the $K$ nearest neighbours of $Q$, with $K$ being an arbitrary number of neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distance calculation\n",
    "The K-NN algorithm hinges on the quantification of *dissimilitude* or *distance* between pairs of instances. The distance $D$ between two instances $A$ and $B$ of length $n$ is calculated with the equation:\n",
    "$$D(A,B) = \\sum_{i=1}^n d(A_i, B_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $d(A_i, B_i)$ is the difference between values at the $i$-th attribute of $A$ and $B$. For numeric and/or ordinal attributes, calculating the difference between $A_i$ and $B_i$ is a simple matter of arithmetic difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance calculation between categorical non-ordinal attributes requires the employment of sets of *rules of substitution* that assign values of dissimilitude to all value pairs possible when comparing observations of these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identity\n",
    "Differentiation by *identity* is the simplest way to measure distance between categorical attributes. The calculation consists simply in assigning a distance/difference score of 1 when two instances have differing values in a given attribute, and a value of 0 if they do not.\n",

    "The problem with using identity as a mesure of differentiation is that it assigns the same distance value to all possible substitutions, which may not be the case in the context of comparing genetic sequences. Special consideration can be given to different pairs of values observed to extract more detailed information about distances between sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "One such consideration is the *K2P* model, which aims to take the different likelihoods of the two types of substitutions that are possible between DNA sequences: transitions and transversions. The model assigns a distance score of 1 to substitutions between bases of the same *type* ($purine \\rightarrow\\ purine$, $pyrimidine\\ \\rightarrow\\ pyrimidine$), and a score of 2 to substitutions between bases of differing types ($purine \\leftrightarrow\\ pyrmidine$).\n",

    "Since the distance values between every possible value pair are known *a priori*, they can be stored in a $4 \\times 4$ matrix in which each cell correspond to a given combination of bases (*A*, *C*, *G*, *T*). A fifth row and column are added to account for missing or unknown data.\n",

    "## Training\n",
    "The training stage for a K-NN algorithm consists simply of loading the reference dataset $R$, which is comprised of a set of $r$ instances of $n$ attributes and a corresponding array $R_y$ of length $r$ containing the class value for each instance of $r$. Taxonomic classifications also present a hierarchical organization with multiple ranks. To acomodate for this, $R_y$ becomes a 2D array of $r$ rows and $u=$ columns with $u$ being the number of available taxonomic ranks. Classifications are produced for every rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequence collapsing\n",
    "When selecting a section of a sequence alignment, it is possible that some instances have a complete coincidence along the selected region. That is, they are effectively indistinguishable within the selected section. In this case, multiple instances may occupy the same place in the instance space. This may not only contribute to artificially inflate the presence of a given class in the vicinty of the query instance, but also might generate a classification conflict if instances of different classes coincide in the selected region.\n",
    "\n",
    "To adress this isue, the reference set $R$ is *collapsed*. That is, the sequences in $R$ are clustered by 100% coincidence in *known* attributes (unknown values in one or both instances compared are not counted as differing values).\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_y$ is collapsed accordingly. For each resulting cluster, classification conflicts are identified and resolved. A *classification conflict* happens when a given cluster contains representatives of different classes at a given taxonomic rank. When one such case is encountered, the class value for the cluster is set as *unknown* at the rank in which the conflict took place, as well as all the ranks below it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collapsed $R$ and $R_y$ are known as $R'$ and $R_y'$. The dimensions of these new matrices are $r' \\times n$ and $r' \\times u$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature selection\n",
    "The amount of information provided may differ among the available attributes (sites of the alignment). In the worst possible case, an attribute is invariable: it presents a single *known* value for all reference instances. Such an attribute has no use in the classification, as it cannot be used to subdivide the alignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Opposite to this, an ideal attribute is one that presents multiple values, each one characteristic to a *taxonomically consistent* (all sequences belonging to the same taxon) subset of the reference set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to determine the utility of any given site an information quantification function based on the *Shannon Entropy index* is implemented. As a reminder, Snannon's Entropy $I$ for a given array $A$ is calculated as:\n",

    "\n",
    "The $I$-index value increases with the amount of values present in $A$ and with the uniformity of their distributions. The $I$-index measures the diversity within a given attribute; by itself is it not enough to determine whether a site is useful in the classification problem. The utility of $A$ depends on how its internal diversity is distributed among the representatives of the different classes to be identified; this distribution can be calculated as the the *information gain* $G_t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G_t = I_{gen} - I_{!t}$$\n",

    "\n",
    "The feature selection process consists of selecting the $N$ most informative attributes for each taxon present in $R_y$. The set of selected attributes for $t$, $S_t^{(N)}$ is built as:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Classification\n",
    "After the training stage is done, the agent is ready to classify unknown sequences. The first step to do this is to build a *query alignment* using the sequence file to be classified. The query alignment is generated by aligning the query sequences against the same guide sequence used to generate the reference alignment. Along with the query alignment, a query id array $Q_{id}$ containing the identifier code of each query sequence is generated. The final query set $Q$ is built by extracting the selected columns $S$ from the query alignment.\n",

    "$$neighbours_q^{(K)} = argsort(D_q)[:K]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neighbour selection criterion\n",
    "Due to the categorical nature of sequence data, distances between instances accumulate in discreet steps resulting in the neighbours of $q$ to be arranged in levels of distance or \"orbitals\" around $q$ in the $n$-dimension sample space. This presents a problem at the moment of selecting the titular $K$ nearest neighbours, as more often than not it is possible that more than $K$ neighbours occupy the first orbital (failing that, less than $K$ neighbours could fill the inner orbitals, but the orbital containing the $K$-th neighbour includes additional neighbours). In order to adhere strictly to the $K$ neighbour criterion it would be necessarily to arbitrarily discard neighbours until only $K$ are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two alternative criteria are deployed to circunvent this issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neighbour criterion\n",
    "The first criterion consists on selecting orbitals *up until* and *including* the one that contains the $K$-th neighbour. All the neighbours included in the selected orbitals are considered in the classification, regardless if the final number of neigbhours exceeds $K$. This criterion tends to be more conservative than the next one, provided the innermost orbitals are sufficiently populated and the selected value of $K$ is not very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this method, neighbours are selected as those with a distance to $q$ that is *lesser or equal* to $D_q[K]$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Orbit criterion\n",
    "The second criterion consists on selecting the $K$ innermost orbitals, regardless of the number of neighbours included. This method tends to include more neighbours than the previous one unless the inner orbitals are sparsely populated and the selected value of $K$ is not very high.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, neighbours are grouped by their distance to $q$ and the $K$ nearest groups are selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Neighbour weighting\n",
    "In the original implementation of K-NN, the final classification of $q$, $q_y$ is determined through a *majority vote* of the selected neigbhours: The class with the most observation among the $K$ nearest neigbhours is assigned.\n",
    "$$T_q = \\{R_y'[l \\in neighbours_q^{(K)}]\\}$$\n",
    "$$T_q^{count} = count\\_uniques(R_y'[l \\in neighbours_q^{(K)}])$$\n",
    "$$q_y = T_q[argmax(T_q^{count})]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $T_q$ contains the set of taxa present among the selected neighbours and $T_q^{count}$ contains the amount of observations for each taxon in $T_q$\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes in real datasets often have heterogeneous distributions, with some taxa being limited to a single representative. In cases such as these, the number of included neighbours might be higher than the number of actual representatives of the real taxon. This would result in cases where it is impossible for the classifier to produce a correct result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This effect can be mitigated by *weighting* the neighbours. That is, ponderating their impact in the final classification according to their proximity to $q$. It stands to reason that reference instances that are closer to $q$ are more likely to belong to the same category of $q$ than instances that are further away. In fact, the original K-NN algorithm is based on this asumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the traditional *majority vote*, classification may be performed using *weighted K-NN*. In this method, each taxon $t$ represented among $T_q$ has a calculated *support* $\\phi_t$, which is the sum of the weight of each of its representatives:\n",
    "$$t_q = [l\\ \\forall\\ l \\in\\ neighbours_q^{(K)}\\ if\\ R_y'[l] = t]$$\n",
    "$$t_q^{distances} = D_q[l]\\ \\forall\\ l \\in t_q$$\n",
    "$$\\phi_t = w(t_q^{distances})$$\n",
    "with $w$ being the weighting function. The taxon presenting the highest $\\phi$ value is assigned as $q_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two weighting functions are implemented:\n",
    "$$wknn = \\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\frac{d_k - d_i}{d_k - d_1}$$\n",
    "$$dwknn = \\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\frac{d_k - d_i}{d_k - d_1} \\times \\frac{d_k + d_1}{d_k + d_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These functions take as input an ordered array of distances $d$ of length $k$, with $d_1$ being the smallest distance and $d_k$ the greatest distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The set of supports for all candidate taxa for $q_y$ is stored as:\n",
    "$$\\phi_q = [\\phi_1, \\phi_2,..., \\phi_{|T_q|}]$$\n",

    "## Calibration\n",
    "The amount of taxonomic signal present in a sequence alignment may vary among regions and taxa. Thus the parameters needed to recognize specific clades may be influenced by the region of the alignment being worked with.

    "# Concept learning\n",
    "## Prelude\n",
    "While the K-NN algorithm is a well established classification method it is not without drawbacks, especially for the problem of taxonomic assignment. In the first place, K-NN is apt to work on ordinal, continuous data (most usually, numerical values); while the data presented in DNA sequences is discreet and unordered (namely, the four nitrogenated bases). This results in the need to employ workaround methods to estimate the distances between instances, such as the simplistic *identity* method or the arbitrary *model-based* method. Furthermore, the discreet and restricted nature of the differences between instances results in an orbital-like ordering of the neighbours of a given query, in which multiple reference instances are equidistant to the query despite being located in different places of the sample space. In this case, adhering to the $K$ nearest neighbours classification may not be feasible if the nearest orbital to the query is populated by more than $K$ neighbours.Graboid implements a workaround to this problem at the expense of distorting the value of $K$ selected neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second drawback involves a problem specific to the K-NN algorithm: heterogeneous representation of the classes in the dataset. The number of recorded sequences in a reference database varies greatly depending on taxa and taxonomic rank. This is the result of both variable sampling effort (as some taxa tend to be more regularly sequenced than others) and variable degrees of internal sequence diversity between taxa. It is important to note that each instance in a Graboid reference dataset corresponds not to an indiviual organism but to a unique sequence variant of a given molecular marker. Therefore, the number of representatives of a given class are an indicator of its internal diversity rather of its abundance. This is relevant because one of the main criteria for selecting sequences as molecular markers is that they ought to have a low degree of internal diversity in relation to overall diversity, that is, taxa are espected to have few representatives in the sample space. The core notion of \"class neighbourhoods\" emploed by K-NN may not be applicable if most classes are comprised of a signle representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, in order to address the weaknesses of K-NN (particularly severe at lower taxonomic ranks), an alternative classification method is needed. This method should be built to estimate simmilitude between instances using categorical data and not be susceptible to heterogeneous class populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The classification prolem can be presented as: *Given a query $q$ and a set of classes $C$, to which class $c \\in C$ is $q$ most likely to belong to?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the criteria previously established (categorical data and independence of class population sizes in the reference dataset), the chosen approach is the one employed in *Concept learning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A concept $C$ is a category of objects that satisfy a set of specific rules $R_C$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A given object $o$ is said to be a representative of concept $C$ if it is consistent with all the rules in the set $R_C$.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A rule $r_C$ restricts the values that can be observed in a given attribute for an instance to be consistent with the concept $C$\n",
    "> \n",
    "> An object may belong to multiple concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The learning aspect of concept learning consists of identifying the rules of each concept presented in the training datset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Graboid implementation of concept learning, the different taxa $t \\in T$ represented in the reference dataset take the place of concepts, and the sites in the alignment are the attributes from which the rules will be extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the reference dataset contains taxonomic information at multiple ranks, concepts are expected to present a *nested* distribution and instances to belong to multiple concepts at the different levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on genetic diversity\n",
    "Genetc diversity at the intra and inter taxonomic levels is distributed heterogeneously across genomes, deriving in the existence of conserved and variable genomic regions. Genetic markers, and therefore the reference dataset, consist of a restricted portion of the genome that may not contain the information required to wholly discriminate between the represented taxa. It is possible that groups of taxa present no distinguishable sequences at the specified genomic region.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The learning task\n",
    "Recall that a rule consists of a restriction of the observed values $V_{r_C} = \\{V_{r_C}^{(1)}, V_{r_C}^{(2)}, ...\\}$ in a given attribute $A_{r_C}$ that can be used to determine whether an instance is consistent with a given concept. A given rule $r_C \\in R_C$ may be expressed as:\n",
    "> Only instances that present values $v \\in V_{r_C}$ at the attribute $A_{r_C}$ are consistent with concept $C$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, every concept in the dataset presents *at least* one attribute that is useful to discriminate its representatives from the remaining instances. However, it is possible that a concept does not present ideal attributes, or that it contains such a degree of internal diversity that some of its representatives do not present ideal attributes. In these cases, the concept may still be identifyable if there exists a combination of attributes that is unique to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given taxon $t$, sites (attributes) $\\{s_1, s_,2, ... \\} \\in S$ may be typified by their *degree of specificity* with respect to the whole dataset. The characteristics of each possible site type are shown in the following table.\n",

    "A *graboid* reference dataset is comprised mainly of an alignment matrix $R$ and a taxonomic array $R_y$.
