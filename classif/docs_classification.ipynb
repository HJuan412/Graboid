    "### Functions\n",
    "* **calc_distance(seq1, seq2, dist_mat)** Returns the distance between *seq1* and *seq2* using *dist_mat*. <ins>NOTE: moved from *distance* delete that one</ins>\n",
    "* **get_dists(query, data, dist_mat)** Returns the distance between the sequences in a *query* matrix and the sequences in the *data* matrix using *dist_mat*. <ins>NOTE: when *query* has a single sequence it should be reshape into a 2 dimensional array</ins>\n",
    "* **get_neighs(query, data, dist_mat)** Get *query*'s neighbours in *data* ordered by their proximity to *q*. Also returns the sorted distances, calculated using *dist_mat* <ins> NOTE: Deprecated, this function's funtion is fulfilled by classify</ins>\n",
    "* **wknn(dists)** Returns the weighted support for the given distances (*dists*) using the WKNN equation\n",
    "* **dwknn(dists)** Returns the weighted support for the given distances (*dists*) using the DWKNN equation\n",
    "* **softmax(supports)** Calculates the softamx activation given an array of supports. <ins>NOTE: could implement this in the weighted classification</ins>\n",
    "* **classify(query, data, tax_tab, dist_mat, k = 0, mode = 'mwd', prev_dists = None)** Classifies every sequence in *query* using the sequences in *data* as references. *tax_tab* contains the taxonomic ID's for every reference sequence at each taxonomic rank <ins>NOTE: passed table should be preprocessed to contain only the adequate *rows* in the adequate order, and only the taxID columns</ins>. Distance calculation is performed using the given *dist_mat*. Parameter *k* can be either a single value or a list, by default, the classification is performed using all neighbours (This tends to render the *majority* mode useless). If multiple values of *k* are given, classification is performed for each of them. If *prev_dists* is given, it means the distance calculation for the given sites should be added to previous results. This option is used when utilizing multiple values of *n*. Parameter *mode* specifies the classification mode to be used, the characters in the string determine the modes in which to use the *classifier* function:\n",
    "    * *m*: use majority vote\n",
    "    * *w*: use wKNN mode\n",
    "    * *d*: use dwKNN mode\n",
    "* **calibration_classify(q, k_rankge, data, tax_tab, dist_mat, q_name = 0)** Calibration of a single instance using a range of neighbours and all classification methods. Argument *q* is the query instance, *k_range* is the range of neighbours to utilize, *data* is the reference sequence matrix, *tax_tab* is the taxonomy table for the reference data, *dist_mat* is the distance matrix to be used in the classification, *q_name* is the numeric value of the query, used to organize results. Returns three arrays *maj_resutls*, *wknn_results*, and *dwknn_results* containing the classification results generated for each method\n",
    "* **classifier(neighs, tax_tab, k, mode, dists = None)** Called by *classify* to assign classification based on calculated distances. Each row in the *neighs* matrix contains the indexes of each neighbour in the reference data ordered by its proximity to a query sequence. *tax_tab* contains the taxonomic data that will be used to classify (only taxIDs). *k* sets the number of neighbours to be considered in the classification. If *mode* is set to *m*, generate for each row in *neighs* an array containing *row_idx*, *taxonomic rank*, *assigned taxon*, *taxon representatives*, *k*, if multiple taxons are tied as the most represented within the K nearest, put all of them in the report. If *mode* is set to *w* or *d*, the distances matrix must be passed as the *dists* parameter. The provided distances will be used to calculate the support for each neighbour of each sequence using either the *wknn* or *dwknn* functions. The arrays generated when using *w* or *d* modes contain *row_idx*, *taxonomic rank*, *taxon*, *taxon representatives*, *k*, *total taxon support*, *taxon support mean* and *taxon support std*. <ins>NOTE: this function combines the use of *classify_majority* and *classify_weighted*, those two can go. Furthermore, *calibration can be used in place of *calibration_classify*, so that one can go as well </ins>\n",
    "* **classify_majority(neighs, tax_tab, q_name = 0, total_k = 1)** Classify a query instance selecting for each rank the most represented taxon amongst the given *neighs*. Returns an array with columns *q_name*, *rank*, *taxon*, *max value*, *total_k*\n",
    "* **classify_weighted(neighs, supports, tax_tab, q_name = 0, total_k = 1)** Classify a query instance using the weighted *supports* of the given *neighs*. Taxonomy for the provided neighbours is given in *tax_tab*. Argument *q_name* is used to name the query in the result table. Argument *total_k* indicates the number of neighbours considered. Returns an array with columns *query name*, *rank*, *taxon*, *representative count*, *total_k*, *total tax support*, *mean taxon support*, *std taxon supports*, detailing the support for each rank in each taxon\n",
    "* **get_classif(results, mode = 'majority')** Gets a classification from the given result table. Argument *mode* specifies the classification method used to generate the result, values are *majority* and *weighted*\n",
    "* **get_classif_majority(results, n_ranks = 6)** Get the classification from a majority vote result table. Assign the most represented taxon for each rank, if there is a draw, leave the classification ambiguous. Returns an array with the assigned taxon for each rank\n",
    "* **get_classif_weighted(results, n_ranks = 6)** Get the classification from a weighted vote result table. Assign the most supported taxon for each rank, if there is a draw, leave the classification ambiguous. Returns an array with the assigned taxon for each rank <ins>NOTE: could add the softmax support for the assigned classification</ins>"

For a window to be considered, it must over lap with at least a fraction of *min_overlap* with a given match. Updates the *windows* attribute with a dataframe with columns *w_start*, *w_end*, *K*, and *n_sites* for each query sequence.\n",

If a single value for *w_start* is given, it and *w_end* are taken as the coordinates of the sinlge window to be used. Otherwise, each *w_start* value is taken as a window starting position and *w_end* is taken as the window length. Parameters *k* and *n* can be either single values or ranges. If multiple values are provided, each combination is tested. <ins>NOTE: if multiple *n* values are given, call the *get_sites* method of the *Selector* instance. This generates a dictionary with the sites that are incorporated with each incremental value of n. For each iteration, the distance is calculated using only the new additions, and the results of the previous iteration are added afterwards. This cumulative method should reduce computation time via the elimination of redundant calculations</ins>. For each value of *n* classify trying every given *k* value and every given *mode*. The *mode* argument represents the distance calculation modes to be used (*m*: majority, *w*: wKNN, *d*: dwKNN). Argument *crop* determines what is done with the call to *get_valid_windows*\n",
