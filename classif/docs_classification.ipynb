    "* **calc_distance(seq1, seq2, dist_mat)** Returns the distance between *seq1* and *seq2* using *dist_mat*. <ins>NOTE: moved from *distance* delete that one</ins>\n",
    "* **get_dists(query, data, dist_mat)** Returns the distance between the sequences in a *query* matrix and the sequences in the *data* matrix using *dist_mat*. <ins>NOTE: when *query* has a single sequence it should be reshape into a 2 dimensional array</ins>\n",
    "* **wknn(dists)** Returns the weighted support for the given distances (*dists*) using the WKNN equation\n",
    "* **dwknn(dists)** Returns the weighted support for the given distances (*dists*) using the DWKNN equation\n",
    "* **softmax(supports)** Calculates the softamx activation given an array of supports. <ins>NOTE: could implement this in the weighted classification</ins>\n",
    "* **classify(query, data, tax_tab, dist_mat, k = 0, mode = 'mwd', prev_dists = None)** Classifies every sequence in *query* using the sequences in *data* as references. *tax_tab* contains the taxonomic ID's for every reference sequence at each taxonomic rank <ins>NOTE: passed table should be preprocessed to contain only the adequate *rows* in the adequate order, and only the taxID columns</ins>. Distance calculation is performed using the given *dist_mat*. Parameter *k* can be either a single value or a list, by default, the classification is performed using all neighbours (This tends to render the *majority* mode useless). If multiple values of *k* are given, classification is performed for each of them. If *prev_dists* is given, it means the distance calculation for the given sites should be added to previous results. This option is used when utilizing multiple values of *n*. Parameter *mode* specifies the classification mode to be used, the characters in the string determine the modes in which to use the *classifier* function:\n",
    "    * *m*: use majority vote\n",
    "    * *w*: use wKNN mode\n",

    "  Returns dictionary with keys *m*, *w* and *d* and the calculated distances for each sequence\n",
    "* **classifier(neighs, tax_tab, k, mode, distances)** Called by *classify* to assign classification based on calculated distances. Each row in the *neighs* matrix contains the indexes of each neighbour in the reference data ordered by its proximity to a query sequence. *tax_tab* contains the taxonomic data that will be used to classify (only taxIDs). Classification is done using every value provided in *k* (therefore *k* must be an iterable). If *mode* is set to *m*, generate for each row in *neighs* an array containing *row_idx*, *taxonomic rank*, *taxon*, *taxon representatives*, *k*, *mean distance to representatives* and *std distance to representatives*. If *mode* is set to *w* or *d*, the provided distances will be used to calculate the support for each neighbour of each sequence using either the *wknn* or *dwknn* functions. The arrays generated when using *w* or *d* modes contain *row_idx*, *taxonomic rank*, *taxon*, *taxon representatives*, *k*, *mean distance to representatives*, *std distance to representatives* and *total taxon support*. <ins>NOTE: this function combines the use of *classify_majority* and *classify_weighted*, those two can go. Furthermore, *calibration can be used in place of *calibration_classify*, so that one can go as well </ins>\n",
    "* **get_classification(results)** Parses the winning classification from the results generated by *classify*. Paremeter *results* is the dictionary of keys *m*, *w* and *d* generated by *classify*. From each array extractes the winner row for every query sequence for every *k* value for every taxonomic rank. In mode *m*, the winner is determined as the taxon with the most representatives (highest count) amongst the k nearest neighbours. In modes *w* and *d*, winners are determined as those with the highest support. Weighted results are scored with the *softmax* function. Rows corresponding to the winner taxon(s) are extracted for each query/k/rank combination and stored in a dictionary of keys *m*, *w* and *d*\n",
    "* **parse_report(report)** Recieves a dictionary generated by *get_classification* and generates a dataframe with columns *idx*, *rank*, *taxon*, *count*, *k*, *mean distance*, *std distance*, *mode*, *support*, *score*\n",

Returns three arrays *maj_resutls*, *wknn_results*, and *dwknn_results* containing the classification results generated for each method\n",
    "* **classify_majority(neighs, tax_tab, q_name = 0, total_k = 1)** Classify a query instance selecting for each rank the most represented taxon amongst the given *neighs*. Returns an array with columns *q_name*, *rank*, *taxon*, *max value*, *total_k*\n",
    "* **classify_weighted(neighs, supports, tax_tab, q_name = 0, total_k = 1)** Classify a query instance using the weighted *supports* of the given *neighs*. Taxonomy for the provided neighbours is given in *tax_tab*. Argument *q_name* is used to name the query in the result table. Argument *total_k* indicates the number of neighbours considered. Returns an array with columns *query name*, *rank*, *taxon*, *representative count*, *total_k*, *total tax support*, *mean taxon support*, *std taxon supports*, detailing the support for each rank in each taxon\n",
    "* **get_classif(results, mode = 'majority')** Gets a classification from the given result table. Argument *mode* specifies the classification method used to generate the result, values are *majority* and *weighted*\n",

Assign the most supported taxon for each rank, if there is a draw, leave the classification ambiguous.

This cumulative method should reduce computation time via the elimination of redundant calculations</ins>. For each value of *n* classify trying every given *k* value and every given *mode*. The *mode* argument represents the distance calculation modes to be used (*m*: majority, *w*: wKNN, *d*: dwKNN). Argument *crop* determines what is done with the call to *get_valid_windows*\n",
