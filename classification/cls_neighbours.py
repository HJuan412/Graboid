# k_nearest is a list containing information about a (collapsed) query sequence's neighbours
# each element is a 3 element tuple containing:
    # an array with the distances to the k nearest orbitals (or up to the orbital containing the kth neighbour)
    # a 2d array containing the start and end positions of each included orbital, shape is (# orbitals, 2)
    # an array with the number of neighbours contained in each orbital

# _V functions produce results as 3 2d-numpy arrays: k_dists (shape: # seqs, k), k_positions (shape: # seqs, k+1) and k_counts (shape: # seqs, k)
# k_dists produced by knn_neigh has default values of -1 to differentiate empty orbitals from tose with distance 0 (occupied orbitals for this function is <= k)
