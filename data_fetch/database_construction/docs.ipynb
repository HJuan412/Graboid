La búsqueda es realizada de manera automática por la clase Surveyor, la cual realiza la búsqueda cruzada en la base de datos y descarga la lista de códigos de acceso a un archivo temporal. En caso de que la conección se interrumpa durante la descarga, el programa puede reintentar la búsqueda un número predeterminado de veces (el número de intentos por defecto es 3).\n",
