Assumes the columns generated are *qseqid*, *pident*, *length*, *qstart*, *qend*, *sstart*, *send* and *evalue*. Max e-value allowed is determined by the argument *evalue*. Additionally, reverse match coordinates (*qstart* > *qend* and *sstart* > *send*) are flipped, and the values of *qstart* and *sstart* are subtracted 1 to account for python indexing. Finally, the table is sorted by *qseqid* and *qstart*.\n",

    "* **get_mat_dims(blast_tab)** Infers the alignment matrix dimensions from the values in *blast_tab*. Returns *nrows*, taken as the number of unique sequences in *blast_tab*, *ncols*, as the maximum extent of matches over the reference sequence, and *lower* and *upper* bounds, which mark the coverage over the reference sequence.\n",
    "* **make_guide(values)** Generates a guide to navigate the coordinate matrix. The parameter *values* consists of the *qseqid* of the loaded *blast_tab* (matches are clustered by *qseqid*). The returned guide consists of a list for which each elements consists of the list \\[accession, index of first occurrence, index of last occurrence + 1\\]\n",

    "* **build_row0(seq, seq_coords, mat_coords, rowlen)** Uses *seq_coords* and *mat_coords* to incorporate *seq* into a row of the alignment matrix. Returns *row*, a numpy array of length *rowlen* containing the aligned *seq* turned to numeric values.\n",
    "* **build_query_window(query_blast, seq_file, w_start = None, w_end = None, w_dict = None)** This method prepares a query file to be classified using a reference dataset mapped against the same reference file used to generate *query_blast*. Parameter *seq_file* contains the sequences to be classified. If *w_start* and *w_end* values are provided, the matrix generated corresponds to the window bounded by these positions. If *w_dict* id given, the matrix generated contains the corresponding coordinates for each sequence. Returns the generated query window and an accession list detailing the sequence corresponding to each row in the matrix\n",

Only the matches below the *evalue* threshold are included in the alignment matrix. The alignment matrix is saved along with a *bounds* array, containing the coordinates of the matrix relative to the reference sequence. The generated *npz* file behaves like a dictionary with keys *bounds* and *matrix*. <ins>NOTE: Matrix dtype is *numpy.int8* to reduce space usage</ins>. The method generates output file names on runtime (names can be specified with the argument *out_name*). If *keep* is set to True, return the generated *matrix*, *bound* and *acclist* arrays."
